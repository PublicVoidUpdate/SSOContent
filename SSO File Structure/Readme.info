Hello! this is the readme for SSO! The only difference between modding and normal versions of the game, 
is the included documentation. Both can handle mods, but the modding version has files detailing what each thing means.
Modding is hardcoded, no loader required, all assets are accessible (see attached lisense for usage of sprites).
All character files and tilemaps are also accessible. You may need to use the tilemap editor program to make and see tiles, 
just because they arent really human readable. If you make irreversible damage to content forlder, just click the refresh button in the game.
Different branche's content folders are different, my goal is to have the same game binary and update the content folders. 

Saves need to have Tilemaps added to them during modding, they only copy form content/tilemaps/ during save creation. 
After that you must manually transfer new tilemaps you want to use. You *will* lose progress of any tilemap you replace.
This is so modded games won't curropt old worlds.


If you encounter errors, include the Manifest.json file as it includes important context for your pc.
